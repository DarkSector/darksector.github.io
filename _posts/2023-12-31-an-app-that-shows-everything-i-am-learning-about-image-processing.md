Okay I am sneaking this in before the year ends. Funny how this will end up being my last post of the year.

Anyway, I am going though Adrian's Pyimagesearch course which I bought 4 years ago but didn't finish and I thought that maybe I might build a Web app that showcases all the things I've learned about image processing. 

Might go serverless or maybe a local docker container. I am going to use OpenCV so it'll be backend heavy. 


Really depends upon how much time I have, life can get crazy busy sometimes. 

Anyway, happy new year 2024!
